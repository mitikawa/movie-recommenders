## Introduction

<br>

This project contains different recommendation systems for you to find your next favourite movie. We have used the MovieLens data available at the [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) website. The current version of the project uses the smallest database.


<br>

## Tools and Features

<br>

This project was developed in the Jupyter notebook environment.

* Python 3.8
* Pandas 1.3.4
* Numpy 1.21.4

The current available recommenders use the following algorithms:

* Modified K-Nearest Neighbors
* Stochastic Gradient Descent

<br>

## Next steps

<br>

Next steps for this project include: 
* Create web app in Flask/Django to allow general public use.
* Develop a content based recommender.
* Include regularization in the gradient descent algorithms.
